# Simple Matrix-based Checkers

Simple checkers game made on 6 hours separated by 3 days, using C++'s matrix systems.
Program's language such as comments or information prints are on PT-BR (Portuguese Brazilian).

This "game" consists in checking logic between pieces from black pieces (written using the letter P because on Portuguese we use "Pretas" for Black) and white pieces (written using the letter B as for "Brancas", which means White in english), checking if the player can take pieces or if they can move to the left if the piece is in the wall.

The game has 4 different logic sets, which are declared as:
- 2 players (no AI)
- 2 players with multi-taking (one of the Checkers rules)
- 1 player against the AI (AI just does random moves lmao)
- 1 player against the AI with multi-taking

If the player's piece gets to the last rank (layer/line/whatever) he wins, mostly for simplicity sake.

The project has some minor bugs but honestly I'm happy with how I made this 1k-line code mess with tons of if-elses in only 6 hours, plus all of this with the multi-taking rules makes it a real speedrun (I guess).

Obviously this was made for logical training and organization-heavy based programming.
